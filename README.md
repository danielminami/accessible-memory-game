## Project Requirements

### Basic Requirements

\[x] The user should have to find a minimum of 10 pairs to win.
* User can choose at the `SettingsFragment` page a different number of pairs to win.

\[x] Keep track of how many pairs the user has found. 
* The `playerMoves` and `remainingPairs` LiveData objects keep track of it.

\[x] When the user wins, display a message to let them know!
* The `isWinnerLiveData` is observed by the View and displays a dialog when condition is true.

\[x] Make sure it compiles successfully.
* An automated build is daily scheduled in [Buildkite] to make sure project compiles and passes all the tests successfully.

### Bonus Requirements

[x] Make the game configurable to match 3 or 4 of the same products instead of 2.
    * `SettingsFragment` page allows users to change the match size.

[x] Make the grid size configurable. (The player needs to match more than 10 sets of the same product).
    * Users can choose both, `Number of Pairs to Win` and `Number of Cards to Make a Match`. This will determine the grid size automatically. The `Utils` class was created to make it look good in different devices and screen sizes.

[x] Build a slick screen that keeps track of the userâ€™s score.
    * A `LinearLayout` was placed in the Game page bottom to keep user posted. This observes the `playerMoves` and `remainingPairs` LiveData objects.

[x] Make a button that shuffles the game.
    * Players are able to reset the game at almost any time. The exception comes when a `Runnable` is being executed.

[x] Feel free to make the app beautiful and add anything else you think would be cool!
    * Please check out the Aditionl
