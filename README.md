## About this project

* As stated at the [Statcan](https://www150.statcan.gc.ca/n1/pub/11-627-m/11-627-m2018035-eng.htm) around 22% of the Canadians has some sort of disability. Accessible Memory Game was developed with special consideration to make it usable for everyone

- [x] Accessibility focused game
    * Three main accessibility considerations are in place in this project: 
        1. All UI elements have `Content Description` added to it. Content dynamically bind also includes appropriate descriptions.
        2. `Focus Order` is consistent. UI was designed to allow the natural flow of the Screen Reader.
        3. More than one `Feedback Mechanism` was implemented to serve users with different kids of disability.

- [x] Game configuration for impaired and non-impaired users
    * At Settings Page, users can switch Accessibility on/off. Switch off accessibility will enable features such as animations and sounds.

- [x] Custom Retrofit Class
    * `CustomRetrofit` implementation enhances code reusability and allows modularized addition of network `Interceptors`.

- [x] Automated tests and build
    * Scheduled builds ran at [Buildkite](http://www.buildkite.com) to ensure code passes tests and compiles successfully. Tests are written in **Kotlin**.

- [x] Settings screen
    * Settings page allows users to change the difficulty level an also set the user experience for Accessibility.

- [x] Custom Fragment Class
    * This extended Fragment Class logs the `Fragment` lifecycle, so we know what is going on under the hood. This is specially handy for debugging, as the application grows.
    
- [x] Winner message
    * When Accessibility is disabled, we celebrate the user's victory with fireworks, we also give extra motivation by playing a winning sound!

- [ ] More Stuff...
    * Oh yeah!!! I wanted to do more stuff. Given the time constraint, I just listed the enhancements at [Issues](https://github.com/danielminami/accessible_memory_game_shopify/issues).

## Libraries

### Android Libraries

|What|Why|
|---|---|
|Live Data|To make the App survive against configuration changes|
|ViewModel|To implement MVVM Archtecture, as ViewModels are Lifecycle Aware|
|ConstraintLayouts|To make it look good with different screen sizes|
|Preferences|To handle user's preferences|


### Third Party
|What|Why|
|---|---|
|Butter Knife|To get layout resources and get rid of some boiler plate code|
|Retrofit|To handle Service Calls|
|Glide|To bind the images bind in the Custom `ImageView`|
|Lottie|To play Animations|
|Junit|To write some Unit Tests|
|Roboeletric|For some kinda Instrumentation test, once the context is needed for some of them :-)|
|GSON|To convert JSON into POJO|
